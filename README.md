<h2>Developing a REST API people management system with Spring Boot</h2>

* Creation of data model for mapping entities in databases.
* Development of user management operations (Registration, reading, updating and removal of people from a system).
* Relation of each of the above operations with the REST architectural pattern, and the explanation of each of the REST concepts involved during project development.
* Development of unit tests for functionality validation.
* Cloud system deployment through Heroku.

To run the project on the terminal, type the following command:

```shell script
mvn spring-boot:run 
```

After executing the above command, just open the following address and view the project execution:

```
http://localhost:8080/api/v1/people
```

Thank you.
